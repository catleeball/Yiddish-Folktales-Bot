*Introduction*

1. See Zinberg \(1975\) vol. 8, which is devoted to this literature.

2. The earlist printed edition appeared in Basle in 1602, compiled by Jacob ben Abraham of Mezritsh, Lithuania \(now Miedzyrzec, Poland\). See Jakob Meitlis \(1933\) *Das Ma’assehbuch, seine Entstehung und Quellengeschichte*, Berlin.

3. The An-ski expedition’s precious collections are stored in several libraries in Leningrad, but unfortunately, scholars in the U.S.S.R. have not published them nor made them available to folklorists from other countries. Little is known of the fate of the tales and other folklore forms collected by the “Historic-Ethnographic Societies in Memory of An-ski” that sprang up in East European towns and cities after An-ski’s death in 1920. We do know, however, that the Historic-Ethnographic Society he founded in Vilna shortly before he died named YIVO as the official heir to its materials, and that they were transferred in 1938. Some of these have turned up in YIVO’s Vilna Ethnographic Commission Archive in New York. See Eleanor Gordon-Mlotok, ed. \(1980\) *S. An-ski, His Life and Works*, catalog, YIVO, New York, vol. 9, pp. 113–19.

4. “Ankete numer 2: Folksmayses,” in *Yedies fun YIVO*, no. 22, July 29, 1927.

5. Szajkovski \(1976\) *YIVO and Its Founders*, catalog, YIVO, New York, p. 13, items 203–7.

6. “Ankete numer 2: Folkmayses,” in *Yedies fun YIVO*, no. 22, July 29, 1927.

7. Cahan, who started gathering Yiddish folklore as early as 1896, was a member of a distinguished circle of collectors in Warsaw, headed by classic Yiddish writer Y.-L. Peretz. When Cahan emigrated to the United States in 1904, he continued gathering material from East European immigrants in this country, and later emerged as mentor to YIVO’s folklorists in Vilna, Poland.

8. Later, when the YIVO *aspirantur* \(an advanced program of study\) was established in Vilna in 1935, Cahan enabled Pipe to attend. Upon completion of the course, Pipe became an associate of YIVO. He published a number of important studies and collections and would undoubtedly have attained eminence had he not died at the hands of the Nazis at the age of thirty-six.

9. A. Litwin \(1917\), vol. 3, “Sonye di Khakhome,” pp. 1–20.

10. YIVO Archive, V.A. 154:150.

11. A. Litwin \(1917\), vol. 3, p. 1 of “Sonye di Khakhome.” See her story “The *Balshem* and the Dibbuk.”

12. The Vilna Archive includes collections created by the YIVO Ethnographic Commission, as well as those received from the Jewish Section of the Minsk Institute for Belorussian Culture and from various Jewish ethnographic societies throughout Eastern Europe. The Cahan and Litwin Archives at YIVO, though much smaller than the Vilna Archives, were also good sources of Yiddish folktales and legends. Litwin’s collection from the 1920s consists of both handwritten tales readers sent him and newspaper clippings of his columns *“Fun zeydns vinkl”* \(“From Grandpa’s Corner”\) and *“Fun ahn kheyder”* \(“From the Old *Kheyder*“\), in which he published legends, short local traditions \(memorats\), and humorous anecdotes. Some of the tales in this volume are from these two archives. I also utilized some fifteen sources of Yiddish oral folktales collected by eminent folklorists such as An-ski, Lehman, Olsvanger, Ravnitski, Pipe, Prilutski, and Wiener. Here I found material to complement the existing body of tales selected from the archival sources.

*Part One*

Epigraph: Yekhiel Shtern \(1950\), pp. 95–96, paraphrased.

*Part Two*

Epigraph: Benyomin Yankev Bialostotzky \(1962\), p. 164, paraphrased.

*Part Three*

Epigraph: Frieda Waletsky, *Yidisher folklor* \(1954\), vol. 1, p. 56. She may well have been referring to tale no. 36, “The Snake Bridegroom.”

1. Adin Steinsalz, *Beggars and Prayers: The Tales of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav*. New York: Basic Books, 1985, p. xvii.

2. Max Weinreich, “Yiddish, Knaanic, Slavic: The Basic Relations” in *For Roman Jakobson*. The Hague: Mouton, 1956, p. 628.

3. Jacob Shatzky, “Mitskevitsh un di yidishe folks-mayse” in *YIVO bleter* \(1934\) vol. 6, p. 186.

*Part Four*

Epigraph: Max Grunwald, “Märchen u. Sagen …” *Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft für jüdische Volkskunde* \(1898\), vol. 5, no. 1, p. 1.

1. Sholem Rabinovitsh \(Sholom Aleichem\), 1955, *The Great Fair: Scenes From My Childhood*, Noonday Press, New York, 1955, p. 184. This is Tamara Kahana’s translation of her grandfather’s childhood memoirs, originally titled *Funem yarid: lebnsbashraybungen*.

*Part Five*

Epigraph: Benyomin Yankev Bialostotzky \(1962\) p. 166, paraphrased.

1. Yehoshua-Khone Ravnitski \(1932\), pp. vii–viii.

2. Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett \(1974\), p. 298; and Ezekiel Lifschutz \(1952\), pp. 43–83.

3. In a class on Yiddish folklore at U.C.L.A. in 1948, Dr. Max Weinreich offered as a possible explanation for Khelm’s status as archetypal Jewish town of fools the fact that the first story of the creation of a golem in Eastern Europe was set in Khelm. In addition to Khelm, there were other towns of fools: the Galician town of Linsk, for example, played the same role in Congress Poland.

4. Toby Blum-Dobkin \(1977\) offers a structural analysis of this genre.

5. Other regions had their favorite local wags. Perhaps less well known are the following pranksters who appear in Yiddish folktales: Mordkhe Rokover, Shayke Fayfer, Shmerl Snitkever, Yosl Marshelik, Shloyme Loydmirer, and Leybele Gotsvunder. See A. Holdes \(1960\), pp. 6–7.

6. Meir Noy \(1968\) speaks of three types of cante fables. In the first, a tune is bought by a naïve fellow, as in our examples; the second focuses on the origin of a famous melody, as in our nonhumorous “The Rebbe’s Melody” \(no. 111\) and “The Dibbuk Melody of Tolne” \(no. 168\); the third is about a person who wants an opportunity to sing, as in “The Clever Little Tailor” \(no. 104\). Cante fables have been collected in Byelorussia, Rumania, and eastern Galicia.

*Part Six*

Epigraphs: Moyshe Meylman, Berestetshka, Poland, 1925, YIVO Archive, V.A. 32:11; Zborowski and Herzog \(1952\), p. 91.

1. For more information on Hasidic legends as they appear in America, see Jerome Mintz \(1968\).

2. See L. Holomshtok \(1930\) for the work of a Soviet scholar who describes many of the Hasidic tales as a form of social protest against various authority figures \(e.g., tax-collectors, local squires, landlords, anti-Semitic priests\).

3. An-ski \(1925\), vol. 5, p. 264.

4. According to An-ski, the typical Jewish hero of post-Biblical legend is not a brave warrior, as in other cultures, but rather a scholar. See An-ski \(1925\) vol. 15, pp. 33ff.
