# ***The Best for My Wife***



A *melamed* went to the butcher shop to buy some meat for his wife, who was in childbed. He asked the butcher to cut him a nice piece. “The best you have,” he said. The butcher showed him some meat, saying, “See how nice and fat it is.”

“If fat is so desirable,” thought the *melamed*, “I’ll buy some fat instead.”

The butcher handed him some fat, saying, “It’s like pure olive oil.”

The *melamed* handed the fat back and went off to buy olive oil. The grocer, as he handed it to him, said “This olive oil is as pure and clear as water.”

“In that case,” said his customer, “let me have some water.”
