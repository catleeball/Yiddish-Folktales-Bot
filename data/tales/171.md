# ***Why the Rebbe’s Pipe Must Be Kept Lighted***



One day a Hasid was on his way to see his rebbe. As he walked along, a woman came up to him and said that he would have to marry her. “I can’t possibly do that,” said the Hasid. “I have a wife and children at home.” But she replied, “If you don’t marry me, I’ll kill you.” The Hasid pleaded with her, saying he couldn’t give an immediate answer, he needed a little time to think it over.

“All right,” said the woman, “you have a year to think about it. After that you’ll have to marry me.” And with these words she disappeared.

The man went to his rebbe and told him what had happened. The rebbe said, “Don’t worry, I’ll help you. Come back to see me before the year is out.”

Six days before the year was out, the Hasid returned to the rebbe. The rebbe seated him at the head of his table and said to the other Hasidim he had called in, “No matter what you see, don’t be frightened.” No sooner had he spoken than a woman came in. At her entrance darkness fell, but when the rebbe concentrated his mind, the room brightened once more. “What is it you want?” asked the rebbe.

“I want my husband,” she replied, “the one who is sitting at the head of the table. He belongs to me.”

“He can’t possibly marry you, because he has a wife and children at home,” said the rebbe. Then, lighting his pipe, he said, “I’ll tell you what. You can marry him when I have finished smoking my pipe. But so long as this pipe stays lighted, you will have no power over him.” He had no sooner spoken than the woman disappeared. And the Hasid went home to his wife and children.

For his part the rebbe took care to keep his pipe lit, and years later on his deathbed he gave orders that it must never be allowed to go out and that it must be kept well hidden. “Because if it ever goes out, she will have power over the Hasid even after his death. She can draw his soul down and force it into the body of some other man, who then must marry her.” And ever since, from generation to generation, the rebbe’s descendants have kept his pipe lighted and hidden.
