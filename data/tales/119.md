# ***Rain and the Rebbe of Stolin***



Yisroel Perlov of blessed memory, the Rebbe of Stolin, went out one fine morning to take a drive in his carriage. As he was riding along, he passed through a village. When the Gentiles in the place realized that it was the Rebbe, a huge crowd gathered, a crowd so dense it became dangerous. The whole village was there, and the people prostrated themselves before the Rebbe’s carriage and would not let him pass.

The Rebbe was astonished, “For heaven’s sake,” he said, “what is it you want?”

“Holy Rabbi,” came the tumultuous answer from the crowd, “we will not let you pass until you promise us rain. It’s nearly three months since we saw any rain. We’re exhausted for lack of water. Everything has dried out: the grain in the fields, our cattle in their stalls. And we have turned gaunt watching them.”

The Rebbe stood, quietly thoughtful, then he looked up at the sky, after which he gestured toward the crowd. “You may go back to your homes. Tomorrow there will be rain.” Then he drove off. When people got up the following morning, they looked at the sky—not even a cloud. It was bright, clear. The sun was blazing. Eleven o’clock came; then twelve. It was nearly one, and still not the slightest trace of rain. What did it mean? What about the Rebbe’s promise?

Suddenly around two o’clock a cloud appeared. The sky grew dark and it began to rain—a veritable deluge. For three days and three nights it poured, filling every lake and river and creek.
