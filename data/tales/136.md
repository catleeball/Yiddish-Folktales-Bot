# ***The Rabbi Shows Respect for His Shoemaker***



The story is told that the humble Rabbi Akiba Eyger once sent a note to his shoemaker asking him to return the boots he had been given for repair. He addressed the shoemaker as follows: “To the Most Holy Revered Great Scholar …” The shoemaker, thinking the rabbi was mocking him, was offended and hurried to him to complain. The rabbi’s reply was of the utmost simplicity: “How can you think I meant to mock you? Letters to me are addressed that way all the time.”
