# ***The Shretele That Took a Little Nip***



Reb Shiye Heshl, a bookbinder, tells this story:

“My grandmother used to tell all sorts of tales, but I have to say that she never told any lies. Once she told us that one day when she was lying in bed, she saw an elf, a *shretele*, crawl out from under it. Her baby was also lying in the bed and crying. The *shretele* went up to it and rocked it for a while, then gave the baby a light slap which made it stop crying. After that the *shretele* trotted up to a cupboard where a flask of brandy was stored. It took out the brandy, had a few nips, and ran back under the bed.

“Well, from that time on, my grandmother never had to buy brandy, because no matter how much you poured out of the flask the *shretele* had sipped from, it always remained full.”
