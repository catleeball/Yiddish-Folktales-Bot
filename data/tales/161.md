# ***The Lost Hat and the Pile of Gold***



A wagon driver coming to harness his gray horse one morning noticed that it was exhausted and sweating. He remembered hearing that *kapelyushniklekh* liked gray horses and often spent the night riding them. He had heard too that if anyone snatched the caps off their heads, they would go away and not return—and moreover, they would pay a lot of money to get their caps back. He knew also that they were afraid of light, and so one night he took a lantern and hid in the barn. As he lay there, he heard his horse whinnying and the sound of running. He stood up and raised his lantern high. The *kapelyushniklekh*, seeing the light, scattered in all directions, and one of them, in his haste, left his cap behind.

The wagon driver took the cap home with him. The next night a couple of *kapelyushniklekh* came to ask for it and promised to give him a great deal of gold in return. He consented, but demanded the gold first. Hardly a moment passed before a heap of gold appeared in front of him, so he gave them the cap. He stood wondering where to hide the gold and which of his debts to pay first—when dawn came, and in the light of day he saw that instead of a heap of gold, there was a pile of rocks lying there.
