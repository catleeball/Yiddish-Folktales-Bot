# ***The Miracle of the Day Well***



The Rebbe of Vizhnits, Reb Mendele of blessed memory, was being driven out of his mind by a man who complained that he had built a house and bricked in a well, and it had all cost him a great deal of money, but there was no water in the well. One day the Rebbe said to him, “When I travel to Kosev to visit Reb Khaim, the route I take will be near your house. Remind me then.”

When the time came for the journey, the Rebbe passed near the man’s house at about the time of early evening prayers. The Rebbe interrupted his journey and said to the man, “I want to wash my hands. Dip up a ladle of water from your well for me.”

“But Rebbe, the well is dry,” said the man.

“Don’t be a fool. Have you ever seen a well without water? Take your ladle and dip.” Since it was the Rebbe’s command, the man did as he was told, and indeed he drew up a ladle of water. The Rebbe washed his hands. “Now dip up a cup of water; I want a drink, too.” The man drew up a full cup of water. The Rebbe drank—and from that time on there was always water in the well.
