# ***Why Khelmites The Fools***



Once upon a time a new Torah reader, a *balkoyre*, came to Khelm just as the annual cycle of readings from the Torah was to begin. The *balkoyre* was not much of a scholar, and instead of reading “*Breyshes, boro elohim es hashomayim*”—“In the beginning, God created the heavens”—he read “*Breyshes, boro elohim es … hashoytim*”—“In the beginning, God created fools.” And since that time, for better or worse, Khelmites have been fools.
