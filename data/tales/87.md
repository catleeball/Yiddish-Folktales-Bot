# ***The Rolling Stone***



There is a huge stone on a high hill in Khelm. It happened once that the Khelmites wanted to move the stone down from the hill. What did they do? They gathered up the entire population and started to drag the stone. When they had dragged it halfway down, a stranger went by. Seeing what they were doing, he laughed at them. “Why are you dragging the stone?” he asked. “Just give it a shove; it’ll roll downhill by itself.” The Khelmites, heeding good advice, dragged the stone back to the top of the hill. Then they pushed it, and it did indeed roll to the bottom by itself.
