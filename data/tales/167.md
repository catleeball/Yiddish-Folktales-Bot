# ***The Demon Sheep***



A Jew was traveling from his village to town. On the way he noticed a bound sheep lying in the road, bleating. The villager jumped down to load the sheep into his wagon. Though the animal was very heavy, the man was not willing to untie it, so he heaved and hauled and labored until at last he got it stowed away. Then he had to crack the whip because the horses could not pull the wagon unless they stretched and strained. As they drew near town, the man felt the wagon moving more easily. Looking back, he saw the sheep standing on its hind legs, exposing its rear end to him. “Ha, ha, ha!” it cried. “I sure made you heave and haul and sweat, didn’t I?” Then it leaped from the wagon and disappeared.
