# ***Neither Eat nor Drink What a Demon Offers***



It once happened that a number of Hasidim, driving in a carriage, came to a town and asked the local *moyel*, the ritual circumciser, to accompany them to a village for a few hours. The unsuspecting *moyel* went with them. They drove on and on, on and on. The trip seemed endless. At last they drove into a dense and very dark forest. In its midst stood a fine house into which they led the *moyel* As he was examining the child to be circumcised, the newly delivered mother said, in a whisper: “Whatever you do, don’t eat or drink anything here or you’ll be lost. These people are demons, and everything you see here is meant to deceive you. Long ago I was traveling when they handed me a drink of water, and from that time on they had such power over me that I could not escape.”

Well, he circumcised the child, after which he was led into a grand hall royally furnished and decorated, with a table full of good things to eat. But when the *moyel* refused to eat or drink anything, the house suddenly disappeared. It was weeks until, footsore and weary, he found his way back to his home town.
