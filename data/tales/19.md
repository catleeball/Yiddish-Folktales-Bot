# ***Sóre-Kháne at the Lip of the Church Lower***



Once upon a time there was a father and mother who went off to the market, leaving their daughter Sóre-Kháne alone in the house.

Sóre-Kháne swept the floor. Then a raven flew down and caught her up in his bill and carried her to the tip of the church tower. When her father and mother came home and saw her at the tip of the church tower, they said, “Sóre, dear. Sóre, dear. Come down from the tower.”

But she replied,


*“No, father, no*.

*You don’t know what I want*.

*The maidens are all married*

*And I’m still all alone.”*


Then her mother called up to her, “Sóre, dear. Sóre, dear. Come down from the tower.”

But she replied,


*“No, mother, no*.

*The maidens are all married*

*And I’m still all alone.”*


Then her brother called up to her, “Sóre, dear. Sóre, dear. Come down from the tower.”

But she replied,


*“No, brother, no*.

*The maidens are all married*

*And I’m still all alone.”*


Now her sister called up to her, “Sóre, dear. Sóre, dear. Come down from the tower.”

But she replied,


*“No, sister, no*.

*The maidens are all married*

*And I’m still all alone.”*


When night fell, she climbed down from the tip of the church tower and went slowly to her house. She stood outside her father’s window and said, “Father, open up.”

“No,” he said. “You wouldn’t come down from the tower when I asked you.”

So she went to her mother’s window, but she also said no. Then to her brother’s—again, no.

So she went to her sister’s window, and her sister opened the door and let her in and sat her down on the oven and fed her boiled groats with milk, and Sóre-Kháne ate it all and went to sleep at once.
