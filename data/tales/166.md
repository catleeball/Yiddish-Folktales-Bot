# ***Late-Night Spooks***



One winter evening a number of men were sitting around in the synagogue telling stories. One of them, a workingman who sat a little apart from the others, fell asleep. Later the synagogue caretaker, not noticing he was there, locked him in the building. In the middle of the night the man awoke and saw a number of white-clad people dancing to the sound of music. He tried to get to the window to call for help, but someone gripped him from behind. Giving a wrench, he pulled away and ran to the window, where he began shouting. A crowd gathered. At last the rabbi, together with a *minyen*, a prayer quorum of ten men, went into the synagogue and escorted him out.

And thatâ€™s why, in the Great Jassy Synagogue in Rumania, they recite their prayers early and avoid prolonging them into the night.
