# ***Napoleon in Vilna***



It is said that Napoleon happened to pass through Vilna on *Tisha b’Av*, the ninth day of the Jewish month of Ab, a day of fasting and mourning. There he visited a synagogue, where he saw Jews seated on the floor and weeping. Curious, he inquired why. Of course he was told that they were mourning for the destruction of the Temple and praying for it to be rebuilt in Palestine.

Napoleon laughed. “And is this the way you mean to retake Palestine? Here,” he said, pointing to his sword, “this is the way to retake Palestine.”
