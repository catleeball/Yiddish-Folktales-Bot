# ***The Wheat Poured In at the Dear***



Once upon a time a very charitable man had a daughter who was about to be married. So he went to the market to buy food for the wedding feast. Everyone knew him. People said, pointing, “There goes the charitable man, there goes the generous man.” Then someone said to him, “There’s an orphan in town who has nothing for her wedding.” So he bought a trousseau with the money he had intended to use for his own daughter, and he led the orphan to the wedding canopy. Having bought the orphan’s trousseau, he had no more than a gildn left. Since he was a dealer in wheat, he bought a gildn’s worth of wheat. He put it into a cupboard in his pantry and went off to the synagogue. When he came back, his wife said, “Look, there’s wheat pouring in at the door,” and indeed, his pantry was so full of wheat that it had overflowed into the house. And that’s how he became a rich man.
