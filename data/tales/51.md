# ***The Miracle of the Tree***



There is a tale of a pious man who had a beautiful garden filled with trees behind his house. One day a hole suddenly appeared in the garden. The man prepared to go and fill it, but as he was about to begin he remembered that it was the Sabbath. “What to do?” he pondered. “If I fill the hole now, I’ll violate the Sabbath.”

He thought it over and finally decided to keep the Sabbath. Then a miracle occurred: a tree grew out of the hole, a tall tree whose branches spread over the garden. And it bore three kinds of fruit, which nourished the pious man’s family.

Now, it was *hakodesh borekh hu*, the Holy One, blessed be He, who did this for the pious man because he had not violated the Sabbath.
