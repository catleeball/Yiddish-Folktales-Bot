# ***Reb Khaim Urbakh Rocks a Cradle on Tom Kippur***



Some eighty years ago Reb Khaim Urbakh was the Rebbe of Lentshits. People said that he used to rise at midnight to study and pray with Elijah the Prophet. There was also a story told about him:

Once, on Yom Kippur eve, as he was on his way to recite the *kolnidre* prayer, he heard weeping from a home on the Jewish street. He went into the house and found a child crying while a girl slept nearby. The Rebbe sat down and rocked the cradle.

Meanwhile at the synagogue people were getting worried because the Rebbe had not been seen. The *shames* ran out to look for him. After hunting for a long while, he finally found him beside the child whom the Rebbe had rocked to sleep.

It was from that time that the Rebbe forbade women to go to *kolnidre*.
