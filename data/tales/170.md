# ***Two Hrubeshoyv Legends***



In Hrubeshoyv there was a *minyen*, a prayer quorum of Jews that was known as the Great *Minyen*. Its members were all holy men living in concealment. All were workingmen: a tailor, a shoemaker, a porter, a carpenter, a smith, and so on. They used to meet after midnight in the small synagogue, where they immersed themselves in the holy Torah. One day they decided to force the Messiah to come.

There are two stories about what happened then: one is that a member of the *Minyen* made a mistake in the names they used to invoke Him and instead invoked the evil Samael, and so they were all consumed by fire. The other version is that the Baal Shem Tov, when he heard what they were up to, dispersed them because it was not yet time for the Messiah. To this day it is said that their gravestones are visible only once a year, on the first day of the month of Elul.

There are all sorts of stories about these holy men. It happened once that the *menoyre*, the seven-branched candelstick, the hanging candelabrum, and various other things were stolen from the synagogue. In spite of an intensive search, the thief could not be found. The Jews of Hrubeshoyv were very unhappy. Then a member of the Great *Minyen* came to the synagogue. It was the carpenter, who took out a large drill and started to bore a hole in the place where the *mezuze* was nailed to the doorpost. Immediately afterward a man with a hole in his head came running, bringing the stolen things.
