# ***Hershele Ostropolyer and the Sabbath Caftan***



It happened that a hungry Hershele Ostropolyer came to a town one day. There he learned that the town’s richest man was marrying off his only daughter. “Hmm,” thought Hershele, “it wouldn’t hurt to look in on the wedding.” But the rich man’s servants refused to let such a ragged man into the house. So Hershele Ostropolyer hurried to a friend’s house and begged him, with tears in his eyes, to lend him his Sabbath caftan. The friend took his new caftan out of the chest and let Hershele put it on. And when Hershele went back to the wedding, he was welcomed and seated in a place of honor. But no matter what good things he was given to eat or drink, he emptied them out on the caftan. Finally someone said, “What are you doing, Hershele?”

“I’m only doing what’s proper,” Hershele Ostropolyer replied. “After all, it’s the caftan, not I, that’s being honored here.”
