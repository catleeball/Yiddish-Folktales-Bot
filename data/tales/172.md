# ***Luckily, the Rooster Crowed Late***



It was twelve o’clock midnight. Suddenly Reb Moyshe heard someone dancing near his window. Since it was summer, he went out of the house wearing only his trousers. All at once he felt himself being grabbed by demons, and the next thing he knew, he was flying through the air. Though he tried, he was unable to cry out for help.

Well, they tormented him all night long until a rooster crowed and he found himself standing in the meadow on the other side of the mill stream. It was still an hour and a half before dawn. When he saw someone he knew, he begged the man to bring him his clothes so he could dress and walk back to town. The man fetched his things, and Reb Moyshe went home.

My grandmother, who told me this story, used to say, “And if the rooster had crowed a little bit earlier, the demons would have dropped him in the middle of the stream.”
