# ***The Poor Man and Rothschild***



There was a poor beggar who went to ask Rothschild for alms. He was met at the door by someone who asked what he wanted. “I have to see the baron,” he replied.

He was led into a room where, shortly, Rothschild’s secretary came in and said, “How can I help you?”

The beggar replied, “I have an important business matter to conduct with the baron.” Well, the long and the short of it was that in spite of the secretary’s insistence that he could help him, the beggar refused to talk with anyone but the baron. Finally there was no help for it; the baron came in and asked the man what he wanted.

“Nothing, really,” said the man. “I simply wanted to ask you for alms.”

“What? Is it for alms that you insisted on seeing me personally? Why couldn’t you have asked my secretary?”

“Dear baron,” said the man, “maybe you’re the world’s greatest financier, but don’t try to give me advice on how to beg.”
