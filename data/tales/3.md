# ***Things Can Always Get Worse***



Once there was a poor man who thought it was too bad that he had to go about begging for bread, and he complained about it to God. With that, a hump grew on his back, and in addition to the hump, a man grew there too, and the man had a mouth as well, and each time the beggar tried to eat a morsel of bread, the man on his back snatched it from him.

Then the beggar prayed, “Neither erase, O Lord, nor write. Let things be the way they were.”

And this is why one must never say that things are bad. They can always get worse.
