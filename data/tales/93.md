# ***Sowing Salt***



Once there was a shortage of salt in Khelm. What to do? The townspeople thought and thought without resting night or day. Then the rebbe, a mighty thinker, had a thought. “Let us go out to the fields, and let us sow salt.” The whole town went out to the fields carrying the last specks of salt they had left. They went to work sowing salt, and after they were done, the rebbe said that he would stay in the fields to guard the crop.

At night the rebbe lay down to sleep. As he slept, a wolf came by and bit his head off. In the morning the whole town turned out to see how the salt was doing. They found the headless rebbe in the field and wondered where his head could be. They sent messengers to the rebbe’s wife with the question: “Do you recall—did the rebbe have a head, or not?” She said she couldn’t remember.

So they went to the cantor of Khelm, who said he couldn’t remember either. People gathered in clusters discussing whether the rebbe had had a head or not. Some cried, “He did,” others, “No, he didn’t.”

They were about to come to blows when a man arrived from another town. “What are you arguing about?” he asked, and they told him about the salt and the rebbe and the rebbe’s head. When he had heard the whole story, he said, “If your rebbe was prepared to sow salt, it’s proof that he didn’t have a head. You can bury him without further ado.”
