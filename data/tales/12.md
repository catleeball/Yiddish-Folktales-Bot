# ***A Fable of a Bird and Her Chicks***



Once upon a time a mother bird who had three chicks wanted to cross a river. She put the first one under her wing and started flying across. As she flew she said, “Tell me, child, when I’m old, will you carry me under your wing the way I’m carrying you now?”

“Of course,” replied the chick. “What a question!”

“Ah,” said the mother bird, “you’re lying.” With that she let the chick slip, and it fell into the river and drowned.

The mother went back for the second chick, which she took under her wing. Once more as she was flying across the river, she said, “Tell me, child, when I’m old, will you carry me under your wing the way I’m carrying you now?”

“Of course,” replied the chick. “What a question!”

“Ah,” said the mother bird, “you’re lying.” With that she let the second chick slip, and it also drowned.

Then the mother went back for the third chick, which she took under her wing. Once more she asked in mid-flight, “Tell me, child, when I am old, will you carry me under your wing the way I’m carrying you now?”

“No, mother,” replied the third chick. “How could I? By then I’ll have chicks of my own to carry.”

“Ah, my dearest child,” said the mother bird, “you’re the one who tells the truth.” With that she carried the third chick to the other bank of the river.
