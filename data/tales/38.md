# ***The Foolish Youth and Elijah the Prophet***



Once there was a couple who had an only son. He was a foolish youth—not at all gifted. Day after day he sat around on top of the oven doing nothing.

Well, nobody lives forever. The youth’s father died. And the mother, it goes without saying, couldn’t chop wood in the forest, so she begged her son, “Please, dear. Go into the forest. Cut wood. Earn something.”

But it was as if she was talking to someone else. He kept sitting on the oven. But hunger accomplished what past pleadings couldn’t. When, finally, there was nothing to eat, he took an ax and a saw and went off to the forest.

The youth cut wood and packed it up and carried it off to sell, the way everyone else did. As it turned out, his customers were very pleased with him, because no matter what the size of his bundle, he didn’t charge more than one gildn for it. He wouldn’t take more; that’s how foolish he was.

One day when he went into the forest, there was no more wood to be found. He was leaning sadly against a tree when a poor old man went by. The man was Elijah the Prophet.

Elijah thought, “I really ought to give him something to bring him luck and make him happy.” So he pronounced: “May whatever the boy says come to pass.” Then the Prophet went on his way.

The foolish youth standing beside his tree said, “Ah me. If only this tree were to fall.” He had no sooner spoken than the tree fell. The boy looked about. “As I live and breathe, the tree has fallen.” Then he said, “If only I had a strong rope.” He had hardly spoken than a strong rope fell over his shoulder. Fingering it, he said, “How nice it would be if I could carry the tree into town.” At once the tree was properly tied and on his back, and he was on his way to the city to sell the wood.

As he walked past the royal palace, the king’s daughter, a magnificent young woman, was standing on the balcony. She saw a man dragging a huge tree, roots, branches, and all. She burst into laughter and cried out to her father, the king, “What sort of creature is that, who can drag such an enormous tree?”

Irritated, the fool called up to her, “May you know as little about why you are carrying a child as I know about why I can carry this tree.” And he went on to the market, where he sold the truly enormous tree for—again—just one gildn. A fool.

But let’s leave him now and talk about the princess. Not long after the foolish youth went by with the tree, she discovered that she was pregnant. She was beside herself. How could such a thing have happened? Then she thought that perhaps she was imagining it. So she went to the royal physician, who said, “It’s not your imagination. You’re pregnant, my dear.” She swore that she had no notion how—or by whom—that could be. The physician replied, “A fact is a fact. You’re pregnant.”

When the queen and the king learned about it—oh my, what a stir. But a fact is a fact. At the end of nine months the princess had a son.

Her parents studied the child’s face, and it was clear that he did not resemble the queen, or the king, or any of the king’s ministers, or his generals. Who was the father?

So the senate had a portrait painted of the child and hung in the great hall. Then they gave a great ball, invited everyone in the city, and searched the faces of all the guests. But the child resembled nobody at all. Too bad.

Now what? Well, one of the senators had an idea. He said, “Perhaps there’s someone who didn’t come to the ball.” And it turned out that there was such a person: the foolish youth. So they looked for him and found him on top of the oven.

“We’re having another ball,” they said. “Please come.”

“I don’t care for dances,” he said.

So they brought him back by force to the palace, where the king and queen looked closely into his face. He was just like the child.

They turned angrily to the princess. “Is this the fellow you’ve been with?”

She said, “Who? What? I have no idea who he is.”

To make a long story short, the king would not believe her and he condemned her to be exiled. She and her child were put on board a ship together with the foolish youth, though he was shut off from them by a stout wall. The ship was supplied with food for a year, towed out to open sea, and set loose—with no helmsman, no sailors, no one.

The ship drifted for a year, and the fool just sat where he had been put. He had food, after all. But when there was nothing more to eat and he grew hungry, he looked about and saw that there was a thick wall enclosing him. “Oh,” he said. “If only there was a hole in the wall.” Even as he spoke, a hole appeared. He looked through it and saw the princess.

She asked, “How did you manage to make that hole?”

He said, “What makes you think I know how I did it?”

She said, “Well, if you make the hole larger, you can come over to me.”

He said, “I don’t mind. Let the hole be larger.” And the hole enlarged and he climbed through it.

Now, the princess was nobody’s fool. She knew that a youth who could make a hole with words instead of tools was no ordinary man. And she had been thinking about her pregnancy, about the youth with the tree who had passed by and about his words to her. She was beginning to understand. So she suggested, “Why don’t you say, ‘Let’s land on the shore’?”

He said, “Well, why not? Let’s land on the shore.” And as soon as he had spoken, the ship pulled up to shore. After they had debarked, she suggested, “Why not say that you want a palace exactly like my father’s?” So he did, and at once a palace exactly like her father’s stood before them. Then she told him to say that he wanted costly furnishings, and soon they lacked for nothing.

And so the princess and the foolish youth lived as happily as birds for a while. One day she suggested, “Why don’t you say that you want a bridge leading from here to my father’s palace?” The moment he spoke the words, a bridge extended across the ocean right to the king’s palace.

The king, when he learned of the bridge, commanded his servants to harness horses to his coach. “Let’s see where this bridge leads,” he said. So four horses were harnessed and all the ministers, generals, and servants got into the coach with the king and queen. And they rode off across the bridge. They rode and rode until they arrived at the other shore. There they got out of the coach and saw what looked exactly like the king’s palace.

The king thought, “What’s this? Have we turned ourselves around? Are we back where we started?”

Now, the princess and the youth had disguised themselves. So when the king saw them standing on the shore, he asked, “Who are you? And what are you doing here?”

They replied, “We’re fisher folk.” Then they added, “It’s nice that you’ve come, since we’re about to celebrate our marriage. Won’t you be our guests?”

And so the marriage was celebrated. Do you think there was anything lacking? It was all exactly as if the richest of kings had arranged it. Golden dishes; golden spoons. And the wonderful foods that were served are impossible to describe.

A golden goblet set with gemstones was placed before the king, such a goblet that the king couldn’t take his eyes from it.

Everyone ate and drank for a day and a night. Then, as the guests were leaving, the princess suggested to the fool, “Why not say that you want the goblet to fall into the king’s pocket?” So the youth did, and the goblet did.

Well, the king and queen and their entourage drove off, and after a while the princess and her husband pursued and overtook them. “Don’t take it ill,” the princess said to the king, “but one of your people has gone off with the goblet.”

Hearing this, the king grew angry and said, “Who would dare? I’ll see that whoever has your goblet is put to death.”

Well, they started to search everyone. The king, putting his hands into his own pockets, cried out, “Oh dear! Look, I have the goblet.” Everyone turned to stare. The king could not possibly have taken the goblet. And yet he had it!

The princess said to the king, “Do you see? Just as you have no idea how the goblet got into your pocket, so I have no idea how I got pregnant.”

At first the king did not understand, but when the princess and her husband removed their disguises, the king flung himself into her arms and they embraced. Oh, what jubilation there was! They all got into the coach and rode home to the king’s palace.

As for her husband, the fool, the king and queen had him educated and he turned into a proper man. And so from that time on they all lived happily ever after.
