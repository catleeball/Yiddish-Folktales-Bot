# ***He Has Only One Weakness***



The *Ksav-soyfer*, a son of the *Khsam-soyfer*, was, like his father, the head of a large yeshiva.

One day a father came to the *Ksav-soyfer* to get some information about a young man who had been proposed as a husband for his daughter. The *Ksav-soyfer* said, “Yes, he’s a fine young fellow. He has only one weakness. He doesn’t know how to play cards.”

The man was astonished. “Rabbi,” he asked, “is that a weakness?”

The rabbi replied, “Yes. If one who doesn’t play cards doesn’t know how to play, it’s not a weakness. But when one who does play doesn’t know how, then that’s a weakness.”
