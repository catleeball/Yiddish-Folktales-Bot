# ***Napolean the First and the Jewish Officer***



At the Battle of Austerlitz, where Napoleon acquired his great fame, he sat on his horse and watched through his field glasses while the Austrian troops died like flies. So he commanded that a white flag be run up as a sign of truce, and he called for any of his officers who could speak German to be brought before him. Naturally most of those who presented themselves were Jews, who, knowing Yiddish, felt confident they could speak German.

The officer whom Napoleon selected was a middle-aged man with a son serving with him in the same regiment. Napoleon sent all the others back to the battlefront and told the officer to sit down. He himself sat at a table and wrote a letter to the Austrian general reproving him for letting his soldiers die in such numbers instead of surrendering.

When the letter was done, he put it into an envelope which he did not seal. “I know you’ll read the letter on the way,” he said to the officer, “so go ahead—you might as well do it now.”

The officer took the letter and read it, then said to the emperor, “Your majesty, my son is serving with me. Permit me to say farewell to him before I leave.”

“What’s this?” Napoleon rose from his desk. “Are you afraid that you won’t return from the mission?”

The officer replied, “I’m certain the Austrian general will have me beheaded.”

Napoleon said, “Mark my words: if he beheads you, I’ll mass my full army, take Vienna, and behead the whole population.”

For a moment the officer was silent. Then he said, “I’m amazed at the concern you have for a Jewish officer. But I must say that no matter how many heads you lop off in Vienna, you won’t find a single one that fits back on my shoulders.”
