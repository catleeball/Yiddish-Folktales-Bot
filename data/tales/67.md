# ***Water Wouldn’t Hurt***



An exhausted Hasid came running to his rebbe. “Rebbe, help. Take pity. My house is burning.”

The rebbe calmed the Hasid. Then, fetching his stick from a corner of the room, he said, “Here, take my stick. Run back to your house. Draw circles around it with my stick, each circle some seven handbreadths from the other. At the seventh circle, step back seven handbreadths, then lay my stick down at the east end of the fire. God will help you.”

The Hasid grabbed the stick and started off. “Listen,” the rebbe called after him, “it wouldn’t hurt also to pour water. Yes, in God’s name, pour water. As much water as you can.”
