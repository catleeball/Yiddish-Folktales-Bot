# ***A Khelm Compromise***



It happened once that the Khelmites had to build a new ritual bath, a *mikve*. When the frame was finished, they turned their attention to making the floor. It was at this point that a quarrel erupted and they broke up into two groups. One group said that it was necessary to plane the floor boards so that people shouldn’t get splinters in their feet. The other group held that the floor boards must not be planed, otherwise they would be too slippery and people would fall. Finally they decided to consult the rabbi and do whatever he told them to. Well, the rabbi of Khelm listened attentively to what each side said. Then he ruled as follows:

“Of course, the floorboards ought to be properly planed, but to keep people from slipping, they must be laid planed-side down.”
