# ***The Princess and Vanke, the Shoemaker’s Son***



Once upon a time there was a king and a shoemaker. Now the king had a daughter and the shoemaker had a son and the children went to the same school. As it happened, the princess was a very poor pupil and Vanke, the shoemaker’s son, was the best in the class. The two of them played together and studied together, the boy helping the princess with her studies, and in the course of time they fell in love.

One day the king, wanting to see how his daughter spent her days, rode to the school. There the girls were playing with the girls and the boys with the boys, but his daughter was playing with Vanke. That seemed shameful to him, so the king sent the princess to another school. She still wanted Vanke to help her, however, and he soon transferred to her school.

When the king next visited the princess at school, he found her playing with Vanke again. So he took her to a school in another city and left orders that no other children were to be admitted. But Vanke went to that city, applied to the school as a teacher, and was set in charge of her class.

The king again visited her school to see who her friends were. As before, he found her with Vanke. So he decided to take her out of school and marry her off.

The princess said to Vanke, “Though you and I love each other, my father is planning to marry me to someone else. Here, take this money to a sorceress and ask her to help us outwit my father.”

Vanke rode away and found a sorceress, who gave him a ring. “Tell the princess to slip this halfway onto her finger,” she said. “It will make her slightly ill. Then let her slip it all the way on and she will fall dead. When she has been buried, dig her up and take the ring off her finger. She will come to life again.”

So Vanke returned home and gave the ring to the princess. On the day that was set for her wedding, she slipped the ring halfway onto her finger and became slightly ill. The doctors advised her to drink a little wine. Then she pushed the ring all the way down on her finger and fell dead. The doctors waited for five days, and when she still showed no signs of life, they buried her.

Afterward Vanke, fortified by a great deal of brandy, went to the cemetery and dug the princess up. As the sorceress had promised, she came back to life when he removed the ring from her finger. She lay ill in his house for several days, then recovered.

Now Vanke and the princess opened a shop to earn their bread. One day the king came in to buy some of the fine cloth that they sold. “You know,” he said to Vanke, weeping, “your assistant looks just like my daughter. Oh, how I miss her!”

Vanke said, “Your highness must stop grieving. Why don’t you hold a feast for the people of the town? It might lift your spirits.”

The king took up this idea, and everyone came to the party except Vanke’s shop assistant. The king looked everywhere for her and wept when he couldn’t find her.

In the meantime Vanke set all the guests to telling stories. When it was his turn, he began, “Listen, my friends. Here’s a problem for you to solve: A rich man had a vineyard, and one day its finest vine withered. Some visitors said to him, ‘You have such a lovely vineyard, but that one withered vine mars its beauty.’ So the rich man tore up the withered vine and threw it into the street.

“A poor man going by saw the vine and took it home. He planted it and tended it carefully. One day the rich man came along and, recognizing the now flourishing plant, said, ‘Give me back my vine.’

“Now, people, what I want to know is this: to whom does the vine properly belong?”

“Why, to the poor man,” everyone said. “To the poor man.”

Then Vanke gave a signal and the princess came in. First she embraced Vanke, then the king, then her mother. “Now,” said Vanke, “to whom does she belong? To me, who rescued her from death, or to somebody else?” Everyone said she belonged to him. So they were married and lived happily ever after.
