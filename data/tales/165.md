# ***A Cave That Leads to the Land of Israel***



The road that leads to a certain village in the district of Shebershin passes between two mountains through such a steep valley that the traveler feels as if he has entered a pit. There is a cave in that valley which the local peasants call the “Synagogue.” The story is told that when the Jews found their way into Poland after their expulsion from Spain, they stopped in the cave to rest and study and pray. And in nearby trees there are still to be found carved Hebrew words which read as follows: “This is where we completed the reading of the Talmud tractate ‘Shabbat.’ ” And the brook running past the cave is called the Brook of the Prophet Samuel.

Another cave in that region is reputed to lead to the land of Israel. A story is told about a holy man clothed in white who lived some hundred years ago. He was called the White Rebbe and is still widely known for his miracles. He was very anxious to provoke the coming of the Messiah. One day, saying that he was on his way to the land of Israel, he went into the forest. He was followed all the way to the cave by a few pious women and a crowd of pranksters. At the entrance to the cave, he sent a kid in and settled down to wait for three days. When the kid had not returned at the end of that time, he said it proved that this was indeed the road to the land of Israel. Then he himself entered the cave and was never seen again.
