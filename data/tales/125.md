# ***The Curious Disciple***



One of the disciples of Reb Khaskele came to Kozmir and complained bitterly that the local squire, the *porets*, was tormenting him about a debt. That he was threatening to drive him from his home unless the money was paid immediately. Reb Khaskele gave his disciple a letter addressed to the squire, and the Hasid rode away. On the journey he opened the letter and found nothing but blank sheets of paper. The minute he arrived home, he took the letter to the squire and watched as the squire opened it, looked at its contents, turned pale, and said, “Very well, I’ll wait another month.” At the end of the month, the Hasid paid the debt in full. Later the Hasid came to Reb Khaskele again, and the Rebbe said, “If you hadn’t opened the letter, he would have forgiven you the entire debt.”
