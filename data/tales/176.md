# ***The Demon and the Willow Twigs***



One Hoshana Rabba night, a member of the Great *Minyen* of Hrubeshoyv was returning home from a village carrying a *heshayne*, a sheaf of hallowed willow twigs.\* He was on his way to the synagogue to recite the Psalms. As he went along, he met a demon disguised as a woman who had an infant in her arms. The woman stopped him and said, “What is it you’re carrying?”

“A sheaf of hallowed willow twigs.”

“No,” she said, “that’s a broom.”

“A sheaf of hallowed willow twigs,” said he.

“A broom,” said she. And round and round this way they went several times. She wanted him to say that the sheaf of hallowed willow twigs was a broom so that they would lose their sanctity and she would have power over him. Finally he struck her across the face with his sheaf of twigs, and she disappeared. The child she had been holding fell to the ground. He took it into town to the home of a woman who had just given birth. He said to her, “Here is your child.” The people looked in her bed, and there they found a bundle of straw tied up to look like a child.


\* During Succos it is customary to beat a bunch of willow twigs against the reading desk of the synagogue as an accompaniment to prayer.
