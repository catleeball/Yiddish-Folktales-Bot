# ***The Treasure at Home***



*The Rebbe of Aleksander used to say, “Many people think that when they come to the rebbe, they will be helped,” And he liked to tell this tale to young people who came to see him for the first time*.

One night, Ayzik, the son of Reb Yekl, dreamed that there was a treasure hidden under the Praga side of the Warsaw bridge. So he traveled to Warsaw. At the bridge he tried to reach the spot, but a soldier was standing guard there. So he paced back and forth as he waited for the soldier to go away. The soldier meanwhile became aware of someone on the bridge, so he went up to Ayzik and asked what he wanted. Ayzik told him the truth: that he had dreamed about a treasure buried under the bridge. The soldier said, “Aw, go on. Just because I dreamed about a treasure in the oven at the home of Ayzik, Reb Yekl’s son in Cracow, doesn’t mean I have to go there.”

Ayzik turned around and went home, where he took his oven apart and found a treasure that made him a very rich man.
