# ***Don’t go into the Mud in the First Place***



When the Rebbe of Radzin was still quite a young man, he came into his *shtibl* one day and found a couple of Hasidim engaged in an intense scholarly debate, which they could not bring to a conclusion. Because the Rebbe of Radzin was famous for his scholarship, they asked him to decide between them. Instead, he told the following tale:

Once a group of wagon drivers sat talking at an inn. As often happens, the oldest of them presided over the conversation. And now he pointed at a young man and asked, “Who is that young fellow?”

“He’s a young wagon driver,” was the reply.

“Come here, my son,” the old driver said. “Tell me, what do you do when your horses draw your wagon into the mud?”

“You put a lever under the rear axle and lift the wagon out,” replied the young man.

“Oho, clever lad,” said the oldest driver. “But what happens if the lever sinks into the mud as well?”

“You take a beam and put it under the lever.”

“Clever. Oh, very clever. And you call yourself a wagon driver? If you’ve got a lever and a beam, there’s no problem. But what if you don’t have either?”

The young man stood silent, unable to reply.

“I’ll tell you what,” the old wagon driver said. “A good driver doesn’t let his horses pull the wagon into the mud in the first place.”

And with that the Radzin Rebbe showed the two scholars how deeply they had sunk into the mire.
