# ***The Mysterious Gold Chain***



In the old days people used to celebrate the end of the Sabbath with a third meal, a considerable gathering. Just as if they were in the homes of the rich, they served many dishes: borsht, potatoes … Once, just as the Sabbath ended, Khane was sent to bring wood from the shed. As she entered it, a glittering chain dropped from the ceiling and lay upon her neck. A heavy gold chain. Without a moment’s hesitation Khane spread the skirt of her dress and began to gather the chain into it. She pulled and pulled and pulled, as if she were milking a cow.

Inside the house they waited for the wood so they could begin cooking the meal. Khane didn’t come. “Khane,” they called, but there was no reply because she couldn’t interrupt what she was doing. Finally someone opened the door of the shed and called, “Khane,” at which the chain broke with a clang and half of it flew up and disappeared. What was left was worth a fortune, and so all the children were well married.

Things like that don’t happen nowadays. And generally, these miracles used to take place only at the close of the Sabbath.
