# ***Lantekh, the Bridge Hobgoblin***



When the old rebbe, Shneyer Zalmen, was a young man, he lived with his parents-in-law in Vitebsk. Displeased with what they saw as his strange religious behavior, they urged their daughter to divorce him. But despite the problems he created in her life, she was not willing to part from him. She said that her husband was a great man.

In Vitebsk a small river sets off a district called Zadunove from the rest of the town. To get there, one had to cross a footbridge, and for a while, the way across the bridge was barred by a hobgoblin, a *lantekh*. Now, the rebbe’s mother-in-law deliberately sent the rebbe to get her something from Zadunove. As the rebbe started across the bridge, it began to tremble and he felt that someone was trying to tear his fur hat from his head. Understanding at once that this was the hobgoblin’s work, he cursed it and drove it away to the most distant of deserts, saying, “You belong in uninhabited places.”

And from that time on, the *lantekh* was never heard from again.
