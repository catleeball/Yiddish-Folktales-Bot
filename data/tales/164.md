# ***The Calf That Turned to Gold***



There was this widow who had many children. She had to go to work every morning, so she prepared food for the children and then locked them in the house. Every day when she came home, her children told her that a calf had darted out from behind the oven and eaten the meal of the youngest child, Sorele. Each day when their mother started to leave for work, the children would weep because they were afraid of the calf. But since she had to go, there was no help for them. Then one day as the children were eating, the calf darted out once more from behind the oven and began to eat Soreleâ€™s meal. This time the child grew angry and struck the animal on the head with her spoon. In that instant the calf was transformed into a heap of gold. When the widow came home, she could see at once that the gold was worth a fortune.
