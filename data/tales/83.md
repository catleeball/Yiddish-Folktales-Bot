# ***A Shoyfer in Khelm***



One day a stranger arrived in Khelm, a very muddy town, and lost one of his boots in the mud. He looked everywhere but couldn’t find it. Later a Khelmite found it, but since no one in Khelm wore boots, people didn’t know what it was. So they took the boot to the rabbi, and a meeting was called. Everyone looked at the boot, and the rabbi declared that it was a *shoyfer*, a ram’s horn, because a *shoyfer* is long at the bottom and round at the top. So the Khelmites placed the boot inside the *ornkoydesh*, the Holy Ark, in the synagogue.

It happened that the same stranger came back to Khelm and went to the synagogue to pray. When he saw his boot in the Holy Ark, he cried, “That’s my boot! Let me have it.”

But the Khelmites wouldn’t believe him. They shouted that it wasn’t a boot, it was a *shoyfer*. Well, they took the quarrel to the rabbi, who ruled that the boot was a *shoyfer*, but that the stranger should be paid eighteen zlotys just the same for his distress. And that’s what was done. The stranger was paid eighteen zlotys and Khelm “blows the *shoyfer*” with a boot.
