# ***The Pain in the Neck: A Nonsense Tale***



Once upon a time there was a very rich poor man. He had no children except for nine daughters. His oldest son took it into his head to go to the fair. So he saddled a match, rode up the chimney, and was driven, riding, to the water. Two sieves, one with a bottom, the other without, were floating in the water. He sat down between them and floated. Suddenly he heard someone shout that the synagogue was on fire, so he ran to rescue the bathhouse, but just then remembered that he hadn’t yet eaten. So he went to buy something to eat. Someone said, “You’re going to eat? Today is such an important fast day. The Russians are beating each other.” He went on and was told, “You’re going to eat today? On such a holiday? Your wife has given birth to a boy.” He remembered that he didn’t have any diapers, so he rode to the forest for twigs, but his hands got stuck; so he ran to fetch an ax. As he went, he saw a fly at the tip of the church steeple, and she didn’t look well. So he went to the doctor for medicine. Then he ran into the city to get a pain in the neck, because he *was* a pain in the neck.
