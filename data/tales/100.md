# ***Motke Khabad Needs a Place to Live***



One day while out walking, Motke Khabad stopped on a street to look at a house. Someone passing by said, “Would you like to buy that place?”

“Yes,” replied Motke. “Yes.”

“Have you got the money for it?” asked the passerby.

“Oh, I’ve got the money for the building. The rub is that I haven’t got the money for the loaf of bread you’re supposed to carry across the threshold when you buy a new house.”
