# ***Blood and Water***



Once there was a king who went to the river to bathe. When he came to its bank, he saw that half of the stream was water but the other half was blood. And there was a man in the middle trying to cross over from the blood to the water.

So the king called together priests, rabbis, and other holy folk and asked them what it meant. Strangely, none of them could see anything in the river but water.

Then the king sent for the greatest rabbi in the city, and this rabbi saw exactly what the king saw. “Half of the river is the blood that has been spilled,” the rabbi said. “And the other half is the tears that Jews have wept. The man in the middle is your father, who is trying to go from hell into paradise. But to do this he must wade out of the Jewish blood he has shed, and the river will not let him.”
