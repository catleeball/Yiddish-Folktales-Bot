# ***The Seven Good Years***



A story is told about a man who lost his fortune and became so poor that he had to earn his living as a hired laborer plowing other people’s fields. As he worked behind the plow one day, *Elyohu hanovi*, the Prophet Elijah, appeared to him and said, “You are destined to have seven good years. When would you like them? Now, while you are still young, or later, when you are old?”

The poor man said, “You must be a sorcerer, but there’s no way I can pay you for this prophecy.”

Three days later Elijah came again and repeated the question. And the poor man gave the same reply, because he still thought that Elijah was a sorcerer who expected to be rewarded. On the fourth day Elijah came once more and said, “*Hakodesh borekh hu*, the Holy One, blessed be He, has ordained that you shall have seven good years. Tell me: When do you want them? Now, or when you are old?”

The poor man said, “I pray you, let me go home first and ask my wife.” So he went home and told his wife everything, and she said, “Let’s take them now.”

The man went back to the field, where once again Elijah the Prophet came to him and asked, “When do you want your seven good years?”

The poor man replied that he wanted them now.

Elijah said, “Go home. When you get there you will be blessed with wealth.”

Now, the poor man’s children were playing on a dung heap, and there they found a treasure: enough money to feed them all for seven years. They called their mother, who rejoiced and said to her husband, “See, the Holy One, blessed be He, has been gracious and sent us seven good years. Let us now, as pious people do, practice charity throughout our seven years, and it may be that God will show compassion toward us later.”

And so they did. They gave alms to many people.

The man’s wife told her youngest son, “Dear boy, keep a record of the sums we have given away.” And the boy wrote everything down.

When the seven years were almost up, Elijah the Prophet appeared to the man and said, “The time has come for me to take back what I have given you. I want you to return the money.”

The man said, “I will give it back only with my wife’s permission, because I did not accept it without her permission.” Then he went to his wife and said, “The old man is here again, and he wants me to return what he gave.”

The wife said, “Ask the old man whether he wants to take the money in order to give it to someone else. And ask him if he has found anyone who is as charitable as we have been. If he has, I’ll restore the money so he can give it to those who will make better use of it.”

The Holy One, blessed be He, noted their words and knew of the good works they had performed. And He rewarded them with even more money, so that He might confirm the saying, “Let there be acts of charity.”

Let those who have wealth refrain from taking things for granted, since the Almighty may retrieve it at any moment and give it to someone else, even as He gave the treasure to this poor family. May God’s Holy Name be blessed forever. Amen.
