# ***A Letter to God***



Once upon a time there was a king whose treasurer was one of the most honest men in the world. He managed the national budget, collected taxes, and accounted scrupulously for every penny. The king valued him highly, and this irritated one of the courtiers. “My lord king,” the courtier said, “you have to expect a little larceny when your treasurer is a Jew.”

“What are you talking about?” said the king. “He’s an honest man.”

The courtier said, “Put him to the test; dismiss him. I’ll bet you that his standard of living doesn’t change. Then you’ll know that he’s been stealing from you.”

The king allowed himself to be persuaded. One day he said to his treasurer, “Yankl, I can’t keep you in my service any longer.”

The treasurer wondered what he had done wrong. “My lord, have I not served you faithfully?” he asked. “Is there even so much as a penny missing?” But the king wouldn’t hear a word; he simply told him to pack up and go.

“Where will I go?” Yankl said. “I’ll starve to death. Have pity on me and my family.”

The king’s heart was touched. But still he thought, “I have to test him.” A peasant’s wagon was sent for, and Yankl’s furniture and everything else he owned was piled into it. Then the king gave his former treasurer five rubles and sent him away.

Yankl came to a village, where he moved his family into a hut. And now his life turned dismal. It was just before Passover, and Passover, as everyone knows, is a serious matter. There’s no end to the things one needs. Yet Yankl was penniless, with no job to be had anywhere.

His wife said, “It’s almost Passover, and we have nothing for the holiday meals. Why don’t you write a letter to God in heaven? Tell Him it was like this and this—in short, the whole story; and ask Him to send us some wine and *matse* and meat and dishes—and everything else a Jewish home needs on Passover.”



Yankl looked at his wife in surprise. “Listen,” he said, “you can write a letter to anyone at all—even to the king. But you can’t write a letter to the *reboyne shel oylem*, the Lord of the Universe.”

But she wouldn’t let the matter rest, and finally he thought, “What can I lose, after all?” And he sat down and wrote that he had been an official in the court of King So-and-So; and that he had served him faithfully and had been dismissed just the same; and that he and his family were hungry; and that here it was, nearly Passover; and would God please send wine and mead and meat and fish … Here Yankl listed everything that was needed.

Then he tied the letter to the leg of a bird and the bird flew over cities and towns and from country to country. Flying thus one day, the exhausted bird saw a palace and lighted to rest on one of the window ledges.

Now this was the palace of a very great emperor, the greatest of the kings of the world. And the emperor happened to see the letter tied to the bird’s leg. He commanded that the bird be caught and the letter brought to him, and then he read the tale of the man who had faithfully served his king but had been dismissed; and now he was poor and it was almost Passover time and therefore he begged God to send him wine and mead and meat and fish and utensils and everything else that was needed.

So the great emperor commanded his servants to gather all the things listed in it and pack them into two big chests.

The emperor wrote a letter saying, “I am sending the things you asked for,” and placed this and his ring in one of the chests. Then a guard delivered the two huge chests, setting them quietly in front of Yankl’s door in the middle of the night, and went away.

In the morning when Yankl got up, he tried to open his door but could not and finally climbed out through a window. Seeing two such large chests, he was afraid that something dreadful was in them, that someone might be about to make a blood-libel accusation against him.

He went to call the village magistrate, who ordered the chests opened, found the letter, and read it. “God sends wine and mead and meat and fish and utensils to such-and-such a person.”

What joy there was in Yankl’s home! He was determined to make a Passover feast fit for a king.

The envious courtier came just then to find how Yankl was celebrating Passover. He looked in the window and was dazzled by what he saw: the best of everything. So he ran off to the king to report. “The Jew is presiding over his Passover feast as if he were a king—and it’s all at your expense.” The king got into his carriage and drove off to see for himself. And when he caught sight of Yankl at the head of his bountiful table, the king was outraged. “Now, there’s a Jew for you. A shameless rogue! He complained to me that he was penniless, and look at him, stuffed with money.”

The king ordered Yankl arrested. His house was searched and everything was taken away from him. The king personally took the ring from Yankl’s hand and put him and his wife and children into prison. They were given only bread and water, and Yankl was beaten to make him confess where he had hidden “all the other things he had stolen.” And when the poor man, weeping and wailing, said that he had never stolen so much as a penny from the king, and that it was God who had sent everything, he was beaten all the harder. “Don’t invent tales,” he was told.

It happened then that the great emperor was traveling through his domains to see whether he was being well served and justice was being done. His custom was to visit all the prisons and listen as the inmates told him why they were there.

When the emperor came to Yankl’s country, Yankl’s wife said, “Listen, dear husband: write a letter explaining why you were arrested. Tell the whole story.” So he wrote it all down, and when the emperor entered the prison, he stood to one side and handed him the letter. The great emperor read it and commanded that the king be brought to him. “Why did you arrest this man?” the emperor asked. “He was stealing me blind,” the king said.

Just then the emperor saw his own ring on the king’s finger. “Whose is that?” he asked.

“It’s mine,” the king said. “The Jew stole it from me.”

Now the great emperor told the king the whole story. And the king bowed his head and said, “I am guilty, sire.”

But the emperor was not satisfied. “Who knows,” he said angrily, “how many innocent people you’ve arrested.” He ordered all the jails emptied, and he imprisoned the king and the envious courtier and had them fed on bread and water. And he made a king of Yankl, who leads a happy life to this day.
