# ***A Common Piece of Earth***



Reb Avrom HaMalekh, called “The Angel,” had a number of opponents, *misnagdim*. Once an entire group of them arrived at his house to make fun of him. He knew what they were up to, so he stood at his window and looked out. They came in, but he did not turn around. Some hours passed before he greeted them. They asked, “Why were you looking out the window that way?” He replied, “I was looking at the mountain over there, wondering how a piece of common earth like that can give itself such airs.”
