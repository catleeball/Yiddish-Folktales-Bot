# ***The Ballad of the Faithful Wife***




*Once upon a time a man*

*Left his wife. It was his plan*

*To travel far, to travel near*,

*And he was gone for many a year*.

*Khane, his lovely wife, was left*

*Alone, abandoned, all bereft*.



*One day the man returned, disguised*

*So well he was unrecognized:*

*“Lady, tell me, tell me, pray*,

*Have you fine clothes and do you stray?*

*And tell me, Lady, do you sin?*

*Do you lust for other men?”*

*“I’ve no fine clothes. I do not sin*.

*I do not lust for other men.”*



*He had a brilliant ring, so bright*

*Thirty ounces was its weight*.

*It was worth its weight in gold*

*And it was bright and very old*.



*“This ring so bright is yours to wear*

*If you’ll forget your husband dear.”*



*“The ring is brilliant and it’s bright*

*And thirty ounces is its weight*,

*It’s worth, no doubt, its weight in gold*

*And it’s lovely, and it’s old*,

*But it’s not for me to wear—*

*Instead I’ll mourn my husband dear.”*



*He had an apron, long and white*

*And smooth when washed, a lovely sight*,

*And long it was, down to the ground*,

*The finest apron ever found*,

*And worth a hundred rubles clear*.



*“This apron, Lady, is yours to wear*

*If you’ll forget your husband dear.”*



*“The apron’s surely long and white*

*And smooth when washed, a lovely sight*,

*And long it is, down to the ground*,

*The finest apron ever found*,

*And worth a hundred rubles clear*,

*But it’s not for me to wear—*

*Instead I’ll mourn my husband dear.”*



*“Ah well for me and for my life*

*That I’m your husband, you’re my wife*.

*I thank the moon, I thank the sun*,

*I thank the Lord for what He’s done*.

*I thank thee, Lady, with this kiss*

*And thank my God for wedded bliss.”*
