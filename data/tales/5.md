# ***The Fever and the Flea***



Once upon a time a Fever and a Flea, meeting each other on the road, got into an argument. “You’re a nobody,” the Flea said to the Fever. “Why, you’re so unimportant that you’re invisible.”

The poor Fever, hearing this, was terribly upset. It was more than he could bear to be talked to this way by a flea. “You,” he said angrily, “what makes you think you’re anybody? Just because you can be seen, just because you can leap about, that doesn’t make you better than me.”

“Yes it does,” declared the Flea. “I lead a better life than you do. I wouldn’t trade mine for yours for anything.”

The Fever, red with rage, said, “You lead a better life? You? Ha! Invisible though I am, I wouldn’t trade places with you in a million years.”

The quarrel grew more and more heated until it seemed that the two were about to leap at each other and scratch each other’s eyes out. But finally the Fever calmed down and said, “What’s the point of arguing like this? Why don’t we try an experiment to prove beyond question which of us leads a better life?”

“All right,” said the Flea, “I’m willing. What did you have in mind?”

Said the Fever, “Each of us will go off and find a victim to infest for three days. At the end of that time we’ll meet and compare results. Then we’ll be able to decide which of us has the better life.”

“Very well,” said the Flea, and they shook hands and went their ways.

Three days later they met again. The Fever, seeing the Flea, said, “What’s the matter? You look unhappy.”

“Ah,” said the Flea, “I’ve had a hard time. A very hard time.”

“What happened?”

Heaving a deep sigh, the Flea said, “After we parted, I made my way inside a palace. Ah, it was wonderful there, a veritable paradise. I spent the night in a bed that would have pleased the most demanding public official. What a bed! I wish I could describe it to you. But it’s impossible; after all, I’m a flea and not a poet.

“At midnight just as I was sleeping most sweetly, I felt someone getting into bed with me. Ugh. Whoever it was gave off a terrible smell of brandy. I tried to ignore it, but he started tossing and turning in the bed so I couldn’t get back to sleep. ‘Well,’ thought I, ‘if that’s what you’re up to, let me show you a trick or two.’

“Well, you know me. I’m a flea. I went after him tooth and nail. In no time I gave him a good reason to toss and turn. He was thrashing so hard I had to laugh.

“All at once he uttered a roar that brought everyone in the palace running. ‘A flea!’ someone cried, and then every last one of them went after me. They hunted me up and down, forward and backward. It was all I could do to escape with my life.

“And now I’ve spent the last three days just wandering, hungry and restless. Can’t seem to settle down.”

“How sad,” said the Fever. “You’ve had a really hard time.”

“Yes,” groaned the Flea. “But what about you? How did you make out?”

The Fever stuck his stomach out like a gentleman and said expansively, “Ah, me. I told you I lead a good life. No sooner had I left you than I met a peasant and jumped right into him. Feeling my presence, he ran off to his house and cried to his wife, ‘Woman, I think I’ve got a fever. Get my bed ready.’

“Well, I looked around. It was plain to see that I was in a poor man’s house, but no matter. Once the peasant was in bed, I began to do my business.

“The man’s wife brought him a large bowl of hot soup and some black bread, so I fed nicely on that. Then, to warm us up, she covered us with some pelts and old coats.

“Well, you can imagine how my peasant tossed and turned. Whenever I got a little bored, I would stroll about inside him. Seeing how feverish he was, his wife kept putting good things into his mouth, and of course I got my share. Mmm, mmm, it was tasty. If I hadn’t finally taken pity on him, and if we hadn’t agreed to meet in three days, I’d still be there.

“Well, what do you think?” said the Fever. “Which of us leads the better life?”

“You do,” the Flea admitted, and slunk away.
