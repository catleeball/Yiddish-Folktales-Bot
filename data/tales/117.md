# ***The Right Order Is Important***



There was a certain rich man named Shimen Goldtsvayg whose children all died. Once Reb Shmelke came to Rusmoldavi, where he stayed in the home of Goldtsvayg’s father-in-law. Goldtsvayg too came there for the Sabbath. Reb Shmelke received Goldtsvayg’s petition and asked him, “What is it you want?” “Rebbe, I’d like to have children that will live.” “I understand. The problem is this: you’ve committed a sin. You married the younger of two sisters before the older one was married, and that’s forbidden. But you can resolve the problem. Let your wife’s older sister move in with the two of you, give her a dowry, and see that she gets married. Then you’ll have children that survive.” The rich man did everything the Rebbe told him to do, and his wife gave birth to children that lived.
