# ***Emperor Franz Josef and the Innkeeper’s Infant***



Emperor Franz Josef, disguised as a beggar, came once to Mieditsov, a village near Bitershtayn. There he spent the night at an inn run by a Jew.

The innkeeper had an infant who was lying in its cradle. During the night the baby cried a great deal. The emperor could not endure the poor child’s crying, so he spent the entire night rocking the cradle. In the morning as he was leaving, he turned to the innkeeper and said, “It was the emperor who rocked your cradle.” Then he gave the man a gift and went on his way.
