# ***Czar Nicholas Decrees the Burning of the Talmud***



Czar Nicholas issued an edict to have the whole of the Talmud burned. The chief rabbi then disguised himself as the czar and, preceding the czar to the chancellery, he tore up and burned the papers on which the edict was printed. When the czar came to the chancellery to sign his decree, he saw that all the copies had been destroyed. “Who did this?” he asked. “You yourself,” came the reply. “You were here earlier, and that’s when you did it.”

“Ah,” said the czar, “when Elijah the Prophet meddles in the matter, there’s nothing I can do.”

And the decree was cancelled.
