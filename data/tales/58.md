# ***Only Eleven Little Fish***



Once there was a man and wife who were very poor. They had nine children. That made, including the two parents, eleven all together.

How did they make a living? The man used to go to the river to catch fish, but he never caught more than eleven at one time. His family lived on these eleven fish—one for each of the children, and one each for the husband and wife.

The husband said, “*Reboyne shel oylem*, O Lord of the Universe, how can anyone fill his belly with a single fish? If one of us should happen to die, I would be able to eat two fish. As it is, all I ever get is one.” He repeated this prayer so often that God finally yielded, and one of the children died.

The husband was pleased that two of the eleven fish would now be his. But when he went to the river the next day, he caught only ten fish. God did not send him anymore.

So the husband said, “You see, when there were eleven of us, I caught eleven fish; and now that we are ten, I catch only ten fish. What have I accomplished?”

This was God’s way of showing that it is wrong to pray for the death of children. It does not matter how many children there are in a family; He provides for them all.
