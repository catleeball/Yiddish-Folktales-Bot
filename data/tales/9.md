# ***Poverty Grows and Grows***



Once upon a time a poor man noticed that there was a naked stranger in his house. “Hey,” he shouted, “you get out of my house, do you hear?”

“Dear sir,” said the stranger, “just look at me. How can you bring yourself to drive a naked man into the street?”

“You’re right,” said the poor man, “that would be a sin. But tell me, who are you?”

“You don’t recognize me? Well, to tell the truth, my name is Poverty.”

When the poor man realized that he had Poverty living in his house, he was deeply distressed. He racked his brains for a way to get rid of him. Finally he went to a tailor’s shop, described Poverty, and ordered a suit to fit. The tailor wrote down Poverty’s measurements and went to work.

To pay for the suit the tailor was making, the poor man had to sell everything he owned. But he gritted his teeth and bore it, because anything was better than having Poverty as a permanent guest.

Finally the tailor delivered the suit, and Poverty put it on. “Sorry.” Poverty smiled, “It doesn’t fit.”

The poor man turned on the tailor and cried, “How could you do this to me? I paid you good money, how come you made the suit too small?”

“Don’t scold the tailor,” said Poverty, “it’s not his fault. It’s just that while you were spending the last of your money, I grew bigger.”
